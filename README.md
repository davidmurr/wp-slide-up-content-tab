# Slide Up Content Tab Plugin for Wordpress

I'd never bothered to develop a WordPress plugin before. Suddenly, I had a need to do that. So I did. It probably isn't pretty. It probably looks like someone threw some shoelaces and bubblegum into a rubbish bin and called it code. But, hey, it works. Hopefully it doesn't do anything _bad_.

Use it, improve it, or ignore it â€” that's up to you. But don't blame me if it breaks something.

## Compatibility

So far, I've only tested this in:

* Chrome 46
* Firefox 41

It's been tested with WordPress 4.3.1, but I would imagine that it should work with older versions, at least back to 3.x.
